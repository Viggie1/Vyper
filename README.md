This was a personal project that I did at the end of last year and was my first time making a website. I was extremely
proud of it but I never got the chance to push it to github so I have now. It still needs work as I was unaware of
things such as responsiveness and proper UX design, but still solid for a first go. 

In order to run it as it wasn't deployed (which I may do in the future) I use the Live Server extension of VSCode,
which is also available on other code editors.
